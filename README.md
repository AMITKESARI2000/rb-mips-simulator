# rb_mips_simulator

### Developers:
* Amit Kesari (CS19B003)
* Anu Anand Annu (CS19B044)

### Simulate MIPS Architecture instruction sets
* Main starting file is **gui.py**
* The simulator supports the following MIPS instructions: 
  * add/sub
  * bne/beq
  * jmp
  * lw/sw
  * lui
  * addi  
  * sll/srl
  * li/la
  * slt
  
* The simulator supports at least 4 KB of memory.
* The simulator reads in an assembly file(.asm), executes the instructions, and in the end display
the contents of the registers, and the memory.
* Language used for development: Python.
* The GUI for the simulator has been developed to be simplistic and functional using Tkinter. 
* Tries to point out syntax errors and shows erroneous line.
