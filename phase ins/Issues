1)) if above line has 2 stalls and below has 1 stall, it should merge
2) syscall printing at end or push in WB data



3) error is comming as lui has not written 0x1001 in s0 but lw s1, 0(s0) is accesing it first and not finding the addr.
4) bne stalls always 1



Rules:
    Without Data Forwarding:
        Stall will come after dependency, and instr will resume after WB
        3 stalls will come in case of dependency.

    With Data Forwarding:
        Stall will come but we can data forward in EXE-MEM for add, sub, etc....and in MEM-WB for lw, sw, etc...
        0-1 stall will come in case of dependency

    In a clock cycle, after stall, there will always a stall.
