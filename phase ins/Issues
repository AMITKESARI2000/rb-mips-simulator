Rules:
    Without Data Forwarding:
        Stall will come after dependency, and instr will resume after WB
        3 stalls will come in case of dependency.

    With Data Forwarding:
        Stall will come but we can data forward in EXE-MEM for add, sub, etc....and in MEM-WB for lw, sw, etc...
        0-1 stall will come in case of dependency

    In a clock cycle, after stall, there will always a stall.
