1)) if above line has 2 stalls and below has 1 stall, it should merge
2) syscall printing at end or push in WB data
4) no of blocks - sets



3) error is coming as lui has not written 0x1001 in s0 but lw s1, 0(s0) is accessing it first and not finding the address.
4) bne stalls always 1



Rules:
    Without Data Forwarding:
        Stall will come after dependency, and instr will resume in the sam cycle as WB
        because we are trying to resolve structural hazard by assuming write operations in first half cycle and
        read operations in second half.
        1-2 stalls will come in case of data dependency.

    With Data Forwarding:
        Stall will come but we can data forward in EXE-MEM for add, sub, etc....and in MEM-WB for lw, sw, etc...
        0-1 stall will come in case of dependency

    Stalls are mimicked using the nop operation.
